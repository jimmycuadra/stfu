# STFU

STFU is an AddOn for World of Warcraft (retail) which selectively blocks talking heads based on the presence of the current zone in a blocklist.

# Usage

By default, STFU will block talking heads in all Shadowlands dungeons and allow them everywhere else.
This can be changed by using in game slash commands.
Run `/stfu` in game for detailed help.

# Acknowledgements

This AddOn is based on the AddOn [BeQuiet](https://github.com/Xorag/BeQuiet) by Xorag.
The primary difference is that STFU allows talking heads by default and blocks them based on a blocklist.
